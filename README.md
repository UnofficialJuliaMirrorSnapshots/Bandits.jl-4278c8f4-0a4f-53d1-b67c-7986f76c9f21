# Bandits

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rawls238/Bandits.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rawls238/Bandits.jl)

This package provides tools for simulation of [multi-armed bandit problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit).

## Installation

```
Pkg.add("Bandits")
```


## Documentation

There are several underlying types that need to be constructed before simulation.

The first is a `Bandit` type, which specifies the true distribution of each of the arms. Currently only `StaticBandit` is implemented which takes an array of `Distribution` types from `Distributions.jl` (i.e. `staticbandit([Normal(0, 1), Uniform(0, 1)])`).

The second is a `Policy` type, which specifies the policy the agent is going to follow. This type is used to specify the arm the agent should choose given the agent's beliefs over the arms.

Currently, the implemented policies are:
* Greedy
* Epsilon-Greedy
* ThompsonSampling
* UCB1
* ExploreThenExploit

The third is a `Agent` type, which requires the prior of the agent, the underlying bandit, and the policy the agent should follow. 

Currently, the following Agents are implemented:
* BasicAgent - this agent forms beliefs over the arms based only on observed rewards (via the empirical mean) and an initial belief about the means of the arms.
* BetaBernoulliAgent - this agent has beta priors and should be used wih Bernoulli-distributed arms. Posterior updating is done via the standard Bayesian updating formula for the Beta distribution.
* NormalAgent - this agent has Gaussian priors and should be used with Gaussian arms.

Now, we can call `simulate` and get back a `BanditStats` object which returns the regret and the number of times each arm was pulled.

As well, this package provides an `aggregate_simulate` function which aggregates the results of N simulations run in parallel and returns the average.

Example usage as follows:
```julia
using Bandits

thompson_sampling = ThompsonSampling()
sb = staticbandit([Bernoulli(0.5), Bernoulli(0.6)])
beta_agent = BetaBernoulliAgent([0.6, 0.5], thompson_sampling, sb)
stats = simulate(sb, beta_agent, 100)
print(stats.regret)
```
